# Python Exception Handling in knowledge-base

When working with Python files within the `knowledge-base` directory, please adhere to the following exception handling guideline:

**Avoid broad exception catches.** Do not use generic `except Exception as e:` blocks that simply print the exception and continue. Instead, allow exceptions to propagate (fail fast) unless you have a specific, well-understood reason to catch and handle a particular type of exception.

For example, instead of:

```python
try:
    # some operation
    result = risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    result = None # or some default
```

Prefer to let the exception propagate:

```python
# some operation
result = risky_operation() # If this fails, let it fail and stop execution
```

Let most errors just crash the application. This is what users want.
